# Breakage Point Finder

##Overview
This is a "real" Readme file.

## Installation
1. Make a virtual environment (checkout virtualenvwrapper)

2. ```python setup.py develop```

### Dependencies
The following dependencies are required:
1. Biopython
Is there a specific version?

2. Blastn
Describe where to get this and how it should be set up
```sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+```

3. A local copy of the Human genome
You should describe where to get this, what format is exceptable, etc.
Blastn doesn't just work on any version of the Human genome.

Is "human_genomic" the same as GRCh38 or are there subtle differences?
